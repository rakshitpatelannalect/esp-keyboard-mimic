- Test coverage with **gcov/lcov**
- Integration with CI pipeline

#### 2.1.2 Desktop Application Unit Testing
- **Jest** for JavaScript/TypeScript logic
  - Component tests with React Testing Library
  - State management tests for Redux
  - Mock APIs for external dependencies
- **Electron Mocha** for Electron-specific tests
- Snapshot testing for UI components
- Coverage reporting with **istanbul**

### 2.2 Integration Testing

#### 2.2.1 Hardware-Software Integration

- BLE reconnection and error recovery tests

### 2.3 End-to-End Testing

#### 2.3.1 Desktop Application E2E
- **Playwright** for automated UI testing
  - Cross-platform validation (Windows/macOS/Linux)
  - Interface interaction simulation
  - Visual regression testing
