# ESP Keyboard Mimic - Technical Specification

## 1. System Architecture

### 1.1 Overview
The ESP Keyboard Mimic system consists of two main components working together:
- ESP32 microcontroller (acting as wireless HID keyboard emulator)
- Desktop application (floating window interface with configuration capabilities)

The desktop application will handle both the text input interface and device configuration, with potential for future cloud synchronization similar to applications like Notion or Evernote.

### 1.2 Data Flow
1. User enters or captures text through the desktop application on the controller device
2. Text is encrypted and transmitted to the ESP32 device via WiFi
3. ESP32 decrypts the content and emulates wireless keyboard input on the target device via Bluetooth HID
4. Status information flows back to the desktop application for user feedback
5. Optional: Desktop application may sync configurations and text snippets to cloud storage in future versions

### 1.3 Dual-Device Connection Architecture
The system operates with a dual-device connection topology:

1. **Controller Device**: Runs the desktop application, provides text content
   - Connects to ESP32 via WiFi hotspot
   - Sends text and commands to ESP32
   - Receives status updates from ESP32

2. **Target Device**: Receives the typed text
   - ESP32 connects via Bluetooth HID
   - Recognizes ESP32 as standard Bluetooth keyboard
   - No special software required on target device
   
The ESP32 bridges these two connections, maintaining both simultaneously.

### 1.4 Quick Access Features
- Floating desktop controller with one-click typing initiation
