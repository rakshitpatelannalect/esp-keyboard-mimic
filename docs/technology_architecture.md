## 2. Technology Integration Points

### 2.1 Dual-Device Connection Architecture

#### 2.1.1 Connection Topology Challenge
- **Key Challenge**: ESP32 must simultaneously:
  1. Act as a Bluetooth HID keyboard to the target device (where text will be typed)
  2. Communicate with the controller device (running our desktop application)

#### 2.1.2 Solution Architecture
- **Bluetooth HID Connection**: Primary connection to target device
  - ESP32 connects to target device via Bluetooth
  - Acts as standard HID keyboard device
  - No special software required on target device

- **WiFi Connection**: Secondary connection to controller device
  - ESP32 creates WiFi access point
  - Desktop controller application connects to this network
  - Text content transferred over this separate connection
  - Completely independent from the Bluetooth HID connection

#### 2.1.3 WiFi Access Point Security Implementation

- **Limited Connection WiFi Hotspot**
  - ESP32 creates a secure WiFi access point with maximum 1 client capacity
  - Prevents multiple connections that could lead to unauthorized access
  - Client MAC address whitelisting for additional security

- **Password Management**
  - Default hardcoded password out of factory (unique per device if possible)
  - Option to change password via desktop application
  - Password stored in encrypted non-volatile storage on ESP32
  - Password change requires current connected session for verification

- **Factory Reset Mechanism**
  - Hardware-based password reset option
    - Physical button combination (press and hold during boot)
    - Timing-based press pattern for security
  - Resets WiFi password to factory default
  - Visual indicator (LED pattern) to confirm reset
  - Optional: Reset counter in EEPROM to prevent brute force attacks

- **Connection Security**
  - WPA2/WPA3 encryption for WiFi connection
  - Unique session token generated on each connection
  - Connection timeout after period of inactivity
  - HTTPS for web configuration interface

#### 2.1.4 Alternative Connection Options

| Connection Method | Pros | Cons | Recommendation |
|------------------|------|------|----------------|
| WiFi + Bluetooth | Longer range for controller, universal HID support | Higher power consumption | Best for stationary setups |
| WiFi + BLE | Lower power, modern devices | Limited compatibility with older devices | Best for most use cases |
| ESP-NOW + Bluetooth | Very low power, simple protocol | Limited controller features, shorter range | For battery-critical applications |

### 2.2 Communication Protocol Design

#### 2.2.1 Protocol Stack
- **Bluetooth LE**
  - GATT service for keyboard control
  - Characteristic for text transmission
  - Notification characteristic for status updates

#### 2.2.2 Data Format
